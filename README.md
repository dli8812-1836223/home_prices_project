# home_prices_project

## Project Description

*Our project focuses on the rental prices for 2-bedrooms for metropolitan areas within the United States. Understanding the rental trends within the past year is extremely important to the economic vitality of any communities, as it attracts and retains workforces for big and small companies. Affordable homes and shorter commutes ensure huge opportunities for any individual and can grow a cityâ€™s community quickly, for it improves individual economic situations and lessens stress for all. We resourced our data from Zillow, which is the leading real estate marketplace that allows us to compare home values and search for listing in an online and convenient way. Within this website, we are able to retrieve data from their research database. Our target audience are college students and recent grads, for awareness about rental and home prices lack in these user groups. Some questions that we want to tackle are:*

- Where are the cheapest places to live?
- What is the trend of the rising rental prices within the past several years (2010-2019)?
- What is the trend on location compared to rental prices?
